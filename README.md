# an angularJS adventure

This is a small repository for a presentation I gave at a lunch and
learn at Sharecare. It's a twenty minute introduction to AngularJS
that shows off some of its capabilities.

It uses [cleaver](https://www.npmjs.org/package/cleaver) to create a
few slides from the lunch-and-learn.md file, and then the rest of it
is a live coding demo of an app running in the ng folder.
