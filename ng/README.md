# an example angular app

From inside this `ng/` folder, get the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

Then serve:

```bash
$ grunt serve
```
Copy any of the numbered files on to the `index.html` to see them at `0.0.0.0:9000/#/`.

For the Firebase example, I've made the backend read-only, but you're free to create your own Firebase account and sample app and just drop in the updated reference url; it should work with no issues.
